# IoT Hub Connection

The 3 IoT Hub Based Examples will require an IoT Hub Device Primary Connection String to work. 

# Deploying from VS Code on Windows

If you want to Deploy from VSCode on a Windows PC, then modify the RaspberryDeployWSL task's ```rsync``` command in the ```.vscode/tasks.json``` files in the various projects to point to your Pi IP Address;

```
"'sshpass -p \"raspberry\" rsync -rvuz $(wslpath '\"'${workspaceFolder}'\"')/bin/linux-arm/publish/ pi@[Enter Your IP Address]:share/${workspaceFolderBasename}/'"
```

Replace the ```[Enter Your IP Address]``` Section with the IP Address of your Pi (No Square Brackets!).

You will also need to change the username (```pi@```) and password (```-p \"raspberry"```) if you have altered those too.

# Debugging from VS Code on Windows

If you want to Debug from VSCode on a Windows PC, then modify the ```.NET Core Launch Console``` task in the ```.vscode/launch.json``` files in the various projects to point to your Pi's Hostname;

```
"pipeArgs": [
    "-pw",
    "raspberry",
    "root@[Your Pi Hostname].local"
],
```

You'll also need to install the VS Debugger;

```
curl -sSL https://aka.ms/getvsdbgsh | bash /dev/stdin -r linux-arm -v latest -l ~/vsdbg
```

You may also need to install curl and zip if they're not already installed;

```
sudo apt-get install curl
```
